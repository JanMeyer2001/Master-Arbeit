# Fourier-Net on CMR

This repository works extends the official implementations of

* 1 **[Fourier-Net: Fast Image Registration with Band-limited Deformation](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i1.25182) (AAAI-2023 oral presentation)**;
* 2 **[Fourier-Net+: Leveraging Band-Limited Representation for Efficient 3D Medical Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02997)**.

## Acknowledgments

Code from the [Fourier-Net](https://github.com/zhangjun001/ICNet) and [VoxelMorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph) projects has been used for this work.
